## Exercise 1: Importing a Hash Database of Known Files in Autopsy
### Description
In this exercise, I imported a hash database of common files into Autopsy. This database, from the National Software Reference Library , contains hashes of typical files. It helps investigators ignore standard files and focus on anything unusual or suspicious on a suspectâ€™s device.
### Why This is Useful
Hash databases let investigators filter out common files automatically, so they can focus on unique or suspicious ones. This saves time and avoids wasting effort on harmless files.
